Updated 04/06/2018.

This is a generic overview of what education I have received
and what I am interested in as a researcher and software developer.
For more details please refer to the CV at the bottom of this page.

## Education

I am currently in the final year of my PhD in Computer Science.
I hold First Class Honours in Computer Science with specialisation in Games.

## Research

My PhD research project is focused on visualizing "grouped networks",
which are data items that have relationships between each other and can also belong to groups.
The visualizations are a combination of an Euler diagram and a graph.
My thesis sets out to provide theoretical techniques for automated visualization of grouped networks.
The project draws on knowledge from the following areas:

* Set Theory
* Graph Theory
* Topology
* Computational Geometry & Graphics
* Euler Diagrams

## Interests & Activities

In my spare time I like learning about new technologies and writing software.
My open-source projects are available
on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AlmasB"><i class="fa fa-github fa-2x"></i></a>.

One of my notable projects is [FXGL](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL).
It is a game development framework that is primarily aimed at academic projects.
The framework does not require any extra setup steps or installation.
This makes the library suitable for the academic environment, e.g. schools, colleges, universities.
In addition, FXGL integrates with many game development tools and provides a wide range
of techniques used in the industry.
Hence, the framework can be used to aid teaching of game development courses.

When I am not developing software, I deliver lectures and tutorials in Computer Science
and Game Development at college and university levels.
I also run an educational YouTube channel,
available at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/almasb0/videos"><i class="fa fa-youtube fa-2x"></i></a>.
The channel mainly covers technologies related to the Java programming language.
It also features a collection of game development tutorials ranging from beginner to advanced levels.
