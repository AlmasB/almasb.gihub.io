This is a generic overview of what education I have received.
For more details please refer to the CV in the sections below.
My academic background and overall experience consist of:

Area                  | % of overall experience
:---:                 | :---:
Software Development  | 40

Having finished school, I have studied English as a second language
(third considering bilingualism).
Thereafter, I took a foundation course in IT and applied for
a BSc in Computer Games, which I have completed with First Class Honours.
Currently I am halfway through my PhD in the area of data visualization.
My research project is focused on grouped networks, i.e.
data items that have relationships between each other and can also belong to multiple groups.
The project draws on knowledge from the following areas:

* Set Theory
* Graph Theory
* Topology
* Computational Geometry & Graphics
* Euler Diagrams

## Interests & Activities

In my spare time I like learning about new technologies and writing software.
One of my notable open-source projects is [FXGL](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL).
It is a game development framework that is primarily aimed at academic projects.
The framework does not require any extra setup steps or installation.
This makes the library suitable for the academic environment, e.g. schools, colleges, universities.
In addition, FXGL integrates with many game development tools and provides a wide range
of techniques used in the industry.
Hence, the framework can be used to aid teaching of game development courses.
